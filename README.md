# Lelelab Y2K 76 Files
A repo of .hex files shared by the developers on Discord and other platforms.

## Where's the source code?
According to my limited contact with the devs, as of time of writing, the firmware is *closed source*. This includes the wiring/layout patch to qmk.

I will probably create this patch myself, although I am unfamiliar with reading electronic schematics so I will be going at my own pace. Help is appreciated!

## Where did you get this/these files?
The initial firmware file (v3.9) posted by a developer on the Lelelabs Discord.

## Just use LeleConsole
You should. However, it seems LeleConsole only allows you to update when it recognizes an existing firmware, so this won't work when testing custom firmware.
